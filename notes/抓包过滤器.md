# Berkeley packet filters

Berkeley Packet Filters (BPF) provide a powerful tool for intrusion detection analysis. Use BPF filtering to quickly reduce large packet captures to a reduced set of results by filtering based on a specific type of traffic. Both admin and non-admin users can create BPF filters.

## Primitives

Primitives are references to fields in a network protocol header, such as host, port, or TCP port. The BPF syntax consists of one or more primitives, which usually consist of an ID, typically a name or number, which is preceded by one or more qualifiers.

- Type qualifiers

  `Type` qualifiers identify the kind of information that the ID name or number refers to. For example, the type might refer to host, net, port, or portrange. When no type qualifier exists, host is assumed.

- Dir qualifiers

  `Dir` qualifiers specify the transfer direction in relation to the ID. For example, the dir qualifier might be src, dst, or src or dst.

- Proto qualifiers

  The `proto` qualifier restricts the match to a particular protocol. Possible protocols are ether, fddi, tr, wlan, ip, ip6, arp, rarp, decnet, TCP, or UDP.

| `[src|dst] net <network> mask <netmask> or [src|dst] net <network>/<len>` | Matches packets with specific netmask.You can also use `/len` to capture traffic from range of IP addresses.Netmask for dotted quad (for example, 192.168.1.0) is 255.255.255.255Netmask for dotted triple (for example, 192.168.1) is 255.255.255.0Netmask for dotted pair (for example, 172.16) is 255.255.0.0Netmask for a single number (for example, 10) is 255.0.0.0The following list shows some examples:`dst net 192.168.1.0 mask 255.255.255.255 or dst net 192.168.1.0/24``src net 192.168.1 mask 255.255.255.0 or src net 192.168.1/24``dst net 172.16 mask 255.255.0.0 src net 10 mask 255.0.0.0` |
