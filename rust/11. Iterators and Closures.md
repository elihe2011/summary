# 11. Iterators and Closures

## 11.1 Closures

Rust's closures are anonymous functions you can save in a variable or pass as arguments to other functions.

### 11.1.1 Capturing the Environment with Closures

```rust
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Copy, Clone)]
enum ShirtColor {
    Red,
    Blue,
}

struct Inventory {
    shirts: Vec<ShirtColor>,
}

impl Inventory {
    fn giveway(&self, user_preference: Option<ShirtColor>) -> ShirtColor {
        user_preference.unwrap_or_else(|| self.most_stocked())
    }
    
    fn most_stocked(&self) -> ShirtColor {
        let mut num_red = 0;
        let mut num_blue = 0;
        
        for color in &self.shirts {
            match color {
                ShirtColor::Red => num_red += 1,
                ShirtColor::Blue => num_blue += 1,
            }
        }
        
        if num_red > num_blue {
            ShirtColor::Red
        } else {
            ShirtColor::Blue
        }
    }
}
    
fn main() {
    let store = Inventory {
        shirts: vec![ShirtColor::Blue, ShirtColor::Red, ShirtColor::Blue],
    };
    
    let user_pref1 = Some(ShirtColor::Red);
    let giveway1 = store.giveway(user_pref1);
    println!(
        "The use with preference {:?} gets {:?}",
        user_pref1, giveway1
    );
    
    let user_pref2 = None;
    let giveway2 = store.giveway(user_pref2);
    println!(
        "The use with preference {:?} gets {:?}",
        user_pref2, giveway2
    );
}
```



### 11.1.2 Closure Type Inference and Annotation

```rust
fn main() {
    let expensive_closure = |num: u32| -> u32 {
        println!("calculating slowly...");
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(2));
        num
    };
    
    println!("result: {}", expensive_closure(5));
}
```

The syntax of closures looks more similar to the syntax of functions.

```rust
fn  add_one_v1   (x: u32) -> u32 { x + 1 }
let add_one_v2 = |x: u32| -> u32 { x + 1 };
let add_one_v3 = |x|             { x + 1 };
let add_one_v4 = |x|               x + 1;
```



For closure definitions, the compiler will infer one concrete type for each of their parameters and for their return value.

```rust
fn main() {
    let example_closure = |x| x;
    
    let s = example_closure(String::from("hello"));
    println!("{s}");
    
    // expected `String`, found integer
    //let n = example_closure(5);
    //println!("{n}");
}
```



### 11.1.3 Capturing References of Moving Ownership

Closures can capture values from their environment in three ways, which directly map to the three ways a function can take a parameter:

- borrowing immutably
- borrowing mutably
- taking ownership

A closure that captures an immutable reference to the vector named `list`:

```rust
fn main() {
    let list = vec![1, 2 ,3];
    println!("Before defining closure: {list:?}");
    
    let only_borrows = || println!("From closure: {list:?}");
    
    println!("Before calling closure: {list:?}");
    only_borrows();
    println!("After calling closure: {list:?}");
}
```



A closure captures a mutable reference:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut list = vec![1, 2 ,3];
    println!("Before defining closure: {list:?}");
    
    // requires mutable binding due to mutable borrow of `list`
    let mut borrows_mutably = || list.push(7);
    
    //println!("Before calling closure: {list:?}"); // cannot borrow `list` as immutable because it is also borrowed as mutable
    borrows_mutably();
    println!("After calling closure: {list:?}");
}
```



To force the closure to take ownership of the values it uses in the environment even though the body of the closure doesn't strictly need ownership, you can use the `move` keyword before the parameter list.

```rust
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let list = vec![1, 2 ,3];
    println!("Before defining closure: {list:?}");
    
    thread::spawn(move || println!("From the thread: {list:?}"))
        .join()
        .unwrap();
}
```



### 11.1.4 Moving Captured Values Out of Closures and the `Fn` Traits

Closures will automatically implement one, two, or all three of these `Fn` traits, in an additive fashion, depending on how the closure's body handles the values:

- `FnOnce` applies to closures that can be **called once**. All closures implement at least this trait, because all closures can be called. A closure that **moves captured values out of its body** will only implement `FnOnce` and none of the other `Fn` traits, because it can only be called once.
- `FnMut` applies to closures that **don't move captured values out of their body**, but that **might mutate the captured values**. These closures can be called more than once.
- `Fn` applies to **closures that don't move captured values out their body and that don't mutate captured values**, as well as closures that capture nothing from their environment. These closures can be called more than once without mutating their environment, which is important in cases such as calling a closure multiple times concurrently.  

The definition of the `unwrap_or_else` method on `Option<T>` :

```rust
impl<T> Option<T> {
    pub fn unwrap_or_else(self, f: F) -> T
    where
    	F: FnOnce() -> T
    {
        match self {
            Some(x) => x,
            None => f(),
        }
    }
}
```



The standard library method `sort_by_key` defined on slices, it uses `FnMut` for the trait bound.

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let mut list = [
        Rectangle { width: 5, height: 2 },
        Rectangle { width: 3, height: 1 },
        Rectangle { width: 4, height: 3 },
    ];
    
    // FnMut, all stuffs inside the closure should be mutable
    list.sort_by_key(|r| r.width );
    println!("{list:#?}");
}
```



## 11.2 Iterators

In Rust, iterators are *lazy*, meaning they have no effect until you call methods that consume the iterator to use it up.

To create an iterator over the items in the vector by calling the `iter` method defined on `Vec<T>`:

```rust
fn main() {
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
    
    for i in v.iter() {
        print!("{i} ");
    }
    println!();
}
```



### 11.2.1 The Iterator Trait and the NEXT Method

All iterators implement a trait named `Iterator` that is defined in the standard library.

```rust
pub trait Iterator {
    type Item;
    
    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item>;
    
    // methods with default implementations elided
}
```

To call the `next` method on an iterator:

```rust
fn main() {
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
    
    let mut v_iter = v.iter();
    
    println!("{:?}", v_iter.next()); // Some(1)
    println!("{:?}", v_iter.next()); // Some(2)
    println!("{:?}", v_iter.next()); // Some(3)
    println!("{:?}", v_iter.next()); // None
}
```



### 11.2.2 Methods that Consume the Iterator

Methods that call `next` are called *consuming adaptors*, because calling them uses up the iterator. The `sum` method, which takes ownership of the iterator and iterates through the items by repeatedly calling `next`, thus consuming the iterator.

```rust 
fn main() {
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
    
    let v_iter = v.iter();
    
    // type annotations needed
    let total: i32 = v_iter.sum();
    println!("{total}");
}
```



### 11.2.3 Methods that Produce Other Iterators

*Iterator adaptors* are methods defined on the `Iterator` trait that don't consume the iterator. Instead, they produce different iterators by changing some aspect of the original iterator.

```rust
fn main() {
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
    
    // type annotations needed
    let v2: Vec<_> = v.iter().map(|x| x + 1).collect();
    
    println!("{v2:?}");
}
```



### 11.2.4 Using Closures that Capture Their Environment

To use the `filter` method that takes a closure. The closure gets an item from the iterator and returns a  `bool`, if `true`, the value will be included in the iteration produced by `filter`. If the closure returns `false`, the value won't be included.

```rust
#[derive(PartialEq, Debug)]
pub struct Shoe {
    size: u32,
    style: String,
}

pub fn shoes_in_size(shoes: Vec<Shoe>, shoe_size: u32) -> Vec<Shoe> {
    shoes.into_iter().filter(|s| s.size == shoe_size).collect()
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    
    #[test]
    fn filters_by_size() {
        let shoes = vec![
            Shoe {
                size: 10,
                style: String::from("sneaker"),
            },
            Shoe {
                size: 13,
                style: String::from("sandal"),
            },
            Shoe {
                size: 10,
                style: String::from("boot"),
            },
        ];
        
        let in_my_size = shoes_in_size(shoes, 10);
        
        assert_eq!(
            in_my_size,
            vec![
                Shoe {
                    size: 10,
                    style: String::from("sneaker"),
                },
                Shoe {
                    size: 10,
                    style: String::from("boot"),
                },
            ]
        );
    }
}
```
