# 15. Object-Oriented Programming Features

## 15.1 Characteristics of Object-Oriented Languages

### 15.1.1 Objects Contain Data and Behavior

The book *Design Pattern: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software*, it defines OOP this way: 

> Object-oriented programs are made up of objects. An object packages both data and the procedures that operate on that data. The procedures are typically called *methods or operations*.



### 15.1.2 Encapsulation that Hides Implementation Detail

 Another aspect commonly associated with OOP is the idea of *encapsulation*, which means that the implementation details of an object aren't accessible to code using that object. Therefore, the only way to interact with an object is through its public API; code using the object shouldn't be able to reach into the object's internals and change data or behavior directly.

```rust
pub struct AveragedCollection {
    list: Vec<i32>,
    average: f64,
}

impl AveragedCollection {
    pub fn add(&mut self, value: i32) {
        self.list.push(value);
        self.update_average();
    }
    
    pub fn remove(&mut self) -> Option<i32> {
        let result = self.list.pop();
        match result {
            Some(value) => {
                self.update_average();
                Some(value)
            },
            None => None,
        }
    }
    
    pub fn average(&self) -> f64 {
        self.average
    }
    
    fn update_average(&mut self) {
        let total: i32 = self.list.iter().sum();
        self.average = total as f64 / self.list.len() as f64;
    }
}
```



### 15.1.3 Inheritance as a Type System and as Code Sharing

*Inheritance* is a mechanism whereby an object can inherit elements from another object's definition, thus gaining the parent object's data and behavior without you having to define them again.



### 15.1.4 Polymorphism

Rust instead uses generics to abstract over different possible types and trait bounds to impose constraints on what whose types must provide. This is sometimes called *bounded parametric polymorphism*.



## 15.2 Using Trait Objects That Allow for Values of Different Types

### 15.2.1 Defining a Trait for Common Behavior

A trait object points to both an instance of a type implementing our specified trait and a table used to look up trait methods on that type at runtime. 

We create a trait object by specifying some sort of pointer, such as a `&` reference or a `Box<T>` smart pointer, then the `dyn` keyword, and then specifying the relevant trait.

We can use trait objects in place of a generic or concrete type. Wherever we use a trait object, Rust's type system will ensure at compile time that any value used in that context will implement the trait object's trait.

To define a trait named `Draw` with one method name `draw`:

```rust
pub trait Draw {
    fn draw(&self);
}
```

To define a struct named `Screen`  that holds a vector named`components`. This vector is of type `Box<dyn Draw>`, which is a trait object; **it's a stand-in for any type inside a `Box` that implement the `Draw` trait**:

```rust
pub struct Screen {
    pub components: Vec<Box<dyn Draw>>,
}

impl Screen {
    pub fn run(&self) {
        for component in self.components.iter() {
            component.draw();
        }
    }
}
```



To define the `Screen` struct using a generic type and a trait bound:

```rust
pub struct Screen<T: Draw> {
    pub components: Vec<T>,
}

impl<T> Screen<T>
where
    T: Draw,
{
    pub fn run(&self) {
        for component in self.components.iter() {
            component.draw();
        }
    }
}
```



### 15.2.2 Implementing the Trait

A `Button` struct that implements the `Draw` trait.

```rust
pub struct Button {
    pub width: u32,
    pub height: u32,
    pub label: String,
}

impl Draw for Button {
    fn draw(&self) {
        // code to actually draw a button
    }
}
```



Another crate using `gui` and implementing the `Draw` trait on a `SelectBox` struct:

```rust
struct SelectBox {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
    options: Vec<String>,
}

impl Draw for SelectBox {
    fn draw(&self) {
        // code to actually draw a select box
    }
}
```



Using trait objects to store values of different types that implement the same trait.

```rust
use gui::{Button, Screen};

fn main() {
    let screen = Screen {
        components: vec![
            Box::new(SelectBox {
                width: 75,
                height: 10,
                options: vec![
                    String::from("Yes"),
                    String::from("Maybe"),
                    String::from("No"),
                ],
            }),
            Box::new(Button {
                width: 50,
                height: 10,
                label: String::from("OK"),
            }),
        ],
    };
    
    screen.run();
}
```



### 15.2.3 Trait Objects Perform Dynamic Dispatch

The monomorphization process performed by the compiler when  we use trait bounds on generics: the compiler generates non-generic implementations of functions and methods for each concrete type that we use in place of a generic type parameter.

When we use trait objects, Rust must use dynamic dispatch. The compiler doesn’t know all the types that might be used with the code that’s using trait objects, so it doesn’t know which method implemented on which type to call. Instead, at runtime, Rust uses the pointers inside the trait object to know which method to call. This lookup incurs a runtime cost that doesn’t occur with static dispatch. Dynamic dispatch also prevents the compiler from choosing to inline a method’s code, which in turn prevents some optimizations. 



## 15.3 Implementing an Object-Oriented Design Pattern

The *state pattern* is an object-oriented design. The crux of the pattern is that we define a set of states a value can have internally. The states are represented by a set of *state objects*, and the value's behavior changes based on its state.

We're going to implement the state pattern in a more traditional object-oriented way, then we'll use an approach that's a bit more natural in Rust.

To implement a blog post workflow using the state pattern. The final functionality will look like this:

- A blog post starts as an empty draft.
- When the draft is done, a review of the post is requested.
- When the post is approved, it gets published.
- Only published blog posts return content to print, so unapproved posts can't accidentally be published

```rust
use blog::Post;

fn main() {
    let mut post = Post::new();
    
    post.add_text("I ate a salad for lunch today");
    assert_eq!("", post.content());
    
    post.request_review();
    assert_eq!("", post.content());
    
    post.approve();
    assert_eq!("I ate a salad for lunch today", post.content());
}
```



 ### 15.3.1 Defining Post and Creating a New Instance in the Draft State

`Post` will hold a trait object of `Box<dyn State>` inside an `Option<T>` in a private field named `state` to hold the state object.

```rust
pub struct Post {
    state: Option<Box<dyn State>>,
    content: String,
}

impl Post {
    pub fn new() -> Post {
        Post {
            state: Some(Box::new(Draft {})),
            Content: String::new(),
        }
    }
}

trait State {}

struct Draft {}

impl State for Draft {}
```



### 15.3.2 Storing the Text of the Post Content

```rust
impl Post {
    // --snip--
    pub fn add_text(&mut self, text: &str) {
        self.content.push_str(text);
    }
}
```



### 15.3.3 Ensuring the Content of a Draft Post Is Empty

```rust
impl Post {
    // --snip--
    pub fn content(&self) -> &str {
        ""
    }
}
```



### 15.3.4 Requesting a Review of the Post Changes Its State

```rust
impl Post {
    // --snip--
    pub fn request_review(&mut self) {
        if let Some(s) = self.state.take() {
            self.state = Some(s.request_review())
        }
    }
}

trait State {
    fn request_review(self: Box<Self>) -> Box<dyn State>;
}

struct Draft {}

impl State for Draft {
    fn request_review(self: Box<Self>) -> Box<dyn State> {
        Box::new(PendingReview {})
    }
}

struct PendingReview {}

impl State for PendingReview {
    fn request_review(self: Box<Self>) -> Box<dyn State> {
        self
    }
}
```



### 15.3.5 Adding `approve` to Change the Behavior of `content`

```rust
impl Post {
    // --snip--
    pub fn approve(&mut self) {
        if let Some(s) = self.state.take() {
            self.state = Some(s.approve())
        }
    }
}

trait State {
    fn request_review(self: Box<Self>) -> Box<dyn State>;
    fn approve(self: Box<Self>) -> Box<dyn State>;
}

struct Draft {}

impl State for Draft {
    // --snip--
    fn approve(self: Box<Self>) -> Box<dyn State> {
        self
    }
}

struct PendingReview {}

impl State for PendingReview {
    // --snip--
    fn approve(self: Box<Self>) -> Box<dyn State> {
        Box::new(Published {})
    }
}

struct Published {}

impl State for Published {
    fn request_review(self: Box<Self>) -> Box<dyn State> {
        self
    }

    fn approve(self: Box<Self>) -> Box<dyn State> {
        self
    }
}
```

To update the `content` method on `Post`：

```rust
impl Post {
    // --snip--
    pub fn content(&self) -> &str {
        self.state.as_ref().unwrap().content(self)
    }
    // --snip--
}
```

 To add `content` to the `State` trait definition:

```rust
trait State {
    // --snip--
    fn content<'a>(&self, post: &'a Post) -> &'a str {
        ""
    }
}

// --snip--
struct Published {}

impl State for Published {
    // --snip--
    fn content<'a>(&self, post: &'a Post) -> &'a str {
        &post.content
    }
}
```



### 15.3.6 Trade-offs of the State Pattern

With the state pattern, the `Post` methods and the places we use `Post` don't need `match` expressions, and to add new state, we would only need to add a new struct and implement the trait methods on that one struct.

The implementation using the state pattern is easy to extend to add more functionality. To see the simplicity of maintaining code that uses the state pattern, try a few of these suggestions:

- Add a `reject` method that changes the post's state from `PendingReview` back to `Draft`
- Require two calls to `approve` before the state can be changed to `Published`
- Allow uses to add text content only when a post is in the `Draft` state. Hint: have the state object responsible for what might change about the content but not responsible for modifying the `Post`



#### 15.3.6.1 Encoding States and Behavior as Types

```rust
pub struct Post {
    content: String,
}

pub struct DraftPost {
    content: String,
}

impl Post {
    pub fn new() -> DraftPost {
        DraftPost {
            content: String::new(),
        }
    }

    pub fn content(&self) -> &str {
        &self.content
    }
}

impl DraftPost {
    pub fn add_text(&mut self, text: &str) {
        self.content.push_str(text);
    }
}
```



#### 15.3.6.2 Implementing Transitions as Transformations into Different Types

```rust
impl DraftPost {
    // --snip--
    pub fn request_review(self) -> PendingReviewPost {
        PendingReviewPost {
            content: self.content,
        }
    }
}

pub struct PendingReviewPost {
    content: String,
}

impl PendingReviewPost {
    pub fn approve(self) -> Post {
        Post {
            content: self.content,
        }
    }
}
```

To modify the `main` function to use the new implementation:

```rust
use blog::Post;

fn main() {
    let mut post = Post::new();

    post.add_text("I ate a salad for lunch today");

    let post = post.request_review();

    let post = post.approve();

    assert_eq!("I ate a salad for lunch today", post.content());
}
```
