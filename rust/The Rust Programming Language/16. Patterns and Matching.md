# 16. Patterns and Matching

Patterns are a special syntax in Rust for matching against the structure of types, both complex and simple. A pattern consists of some combination of the following:

- Literals
- Destructured arrays, enums, structs, or tuples
- Variables
- Wildcards
- Placeholders



## 16.1 All the Places Patterns Can Be Used

### 16.1.1 match Arms

Formally, `match` expression are defined as the keyword `match`, a value to match on, and one or more match arms that consist of a pattern and an expression to run if the value matches that arm's pattern, like this:

```rust
match VALUE {
    PATTERN => EXPRESSION,
    PATTERN => EXPRESSION,
    PATTERN => EXPRESSION,
}
```

Here's the `match` expression that matches on an `Option<i32>` value in the variable `x`:

```rust
match x {
    Some(i) => Some(i+1),
    None => None,
}
```



The particular pattern `_` will match anything, nut it never binds to a variable, so it's often used in the last match arm.



### 16.1.2 Conditional `if let` Expressions

`if let` expressions mainly as a shorter way to write the equivalent of a `match` that only matches one case. Optionally, `if let` can have a corresponding `else` containing code to run if the pattern in the `if let` doesn't match.

```rust
fn main() {
	let favorite_color: Option<&str> = None;
	let is_tuesday = true;
	let age: Result<u8, _> = "34".parse();
	
	if let Some(color) = favorite_color {
		println!("Using your favorite color, {color}, as the background");
	} else if is_tuesday {
		println!("Tuesday is green day!");
	} else if let Ok(age) = age {
		if age > 30 {
			println!("Using purple as the background color");
		} else {
			println!("Using orange as the background color");
		}
	} else {
		println!("Using blue as the background color");
	}
}
```



### 16.1.3 `while let` Condition Loops

The `while let` conditional loop allows a `while` loop to run for as long as a pattern continues to match.

```rust
fn main() {
	let mut stack = Vec::new();
	
	stack.push(3);
	stack.push(4);
	stack.push(5);
	
	while let Some(top) = stack.pop() {
		println!("{top}");
	}
}
```



## 16.2 Refutability: Whether a Pattern Might Fail to Match

Patterns come in two forms: refutable and irrefutable. 

- Patterns that will match for any possible value passed are irrefutable. `x` in the statement `let x = 5;` because `x` matches anything and therefore cannot fail to match.
- Patterns that can fail to match for some possible value are refutable. `Some(x)` in the expression `if let Some(x) = a_value` because if the value in the `a_value` variable is `None` rather than `Some`, the `Some(x)` pattern will not match.

Try to use a refutable pattern where Rust requires an irrefutable pattern and vice versa. As you might expect, this code will not compile:

```rust
let Some(x) = some_option_value;
```

If `some_option_value` was a `None` value, it would be fail to match the pattern `Some(x)`, meaning the pattern is refutable.

Instead of using `let`, we can use `if let`. Then if the pattern doesn't match, the code will just skip the code in the curly brackets, giving it a way to continue validly.

```rust
if let Some(x) = some_option_value {
    println!("{x}");
}
```

If give `if let` an irrefutable pattern (a pattern that will always match), such as `x`, the compiler will give a warning:

```rust
if let x = 5 {
    println!("x");
};
```



## 16.3 Pattern Syntax

### 16.3.1 Matching Literals

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 1;

	match x {
    	1 => println!("one"),
    	2 => println!("two"),
    	3 => println!("three"),
    	_ => println!("anything"),
    }
}
```



### 16.3.2 Matching Named Variables

Named variables are irrefutable patterns that  match any value.

```rust
fn main() {	
	let x = Some(5);
	let y = 10;
	
	match x {
		Some(50) => println!("Got 50"),
		Some(y) => println!("Matched, y={y}"),     // 5, shadow y
		_ => println!("Default case x = {x:?}"),
	}
	
	println!("at the end, x = {x:?}, y = {y}");
}

```



### 16.3.3 Multiple Patterns

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 1;
    
    match x {
        1 | 2 => println!("one or two"),
        3 => println!("three"),
        _ => println!("anything"),
    }
}
```



### 16.3.4 Matching Ranges of Values with `..=`

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    
    match x {
        1..=5 => println!("one through five"),
        _ => println!("something else"),
    }
}
```

Here is an example using ranges of `char` values:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 'c';
    
    match x {
        'a'..='j' => println!("early ASCII letter"),
        'k'..='z' => println!("late ASCII letter"),
        _ => println!("something else"),
    }
}
```



### 16.3.5 Destructuring to Break Apart Values

#### 16.3.5.1 Destructuring Structs

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 0, y: 7 };
    
    let Point { x: a, y: b } = p;
    assert_eq!(0, a);
    assert_eq!(7, b);
}
```

Using struct field shorthand:

```rust
fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 0, y: 7 };
    
    let Point { x, y } = p;
    assert_eq!(0, x);
    assert_eq!(7, y);
}
```

Matching literal values in one pattern:

```rust
fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 0, y: 7 };
    
    match p {
        Point { x, y: 0 } => println!("On the x axis at {x}"),
        Point { x: 0, y } => println!("On the y axis at {y}"),
        Point { x, y } => {
            println!("On neither axis: ({x}, {y})");
        }
    }
}
```



#### 16.3.5.2 Destructuring Enums

```rust
enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
}

fn main() {
    let msg = Message::ChangeColor(0, 160, 255);
    
    match msg {
        Message::Quit => {
            println!("The Quit variant has no data to destructure.");
        },
        Message::Move { x, y } => {
            println!("Move in the x direction {x} and in the y direction {y}");
        },
        Message::Write(text) => {
            println!("Text message: {text}");
        },
        Message::ChangeColor(r, g, b) => {
            println!("Change the color to red {r}, green {g}, and blue {b}");
        }
    }
}
```



#### 16.3.5.3 Destructuring Nested Structs and Enums

```rust 
enum Color {
    Rgb(i32, i32, i32),
    Hsv(i32, i32, i32),
}

enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
    ChangeColor(Color),
}

fn main() {
    let msg = Message::ChangeColor(Color::Hsv(0, 160, 255));
    
    match msg {
        Message::ChangeColor(Color::Rgb(r, g, b)) => {
            println!("Change color to red {r}, green {g}, and blue {b}");
        },
        Message::ChangeColor(Color::Hsv(h, s, v)) => {
            println!("Change color to hue {h}, saturation {s}, value {v}");
        },
        _ => (),
    }
}
```



#### 16.3.5.4 Destructuring Structs and Tuples

```rust
    let ((feet, inches), Point { x, y }) = ((3, 10), Point { x: 3, y: -10 });
```



### 16.3.6 Ignoring Values in a Pattern

#### 16.3.6.1 Ignoring an Entire Value with `_`

```rust
fn foo(_: i32, y: i32) {
    println!("This code only uses the y parameter: {y}");
}
```



#### 16.3.6.2 Ignoring Parts of a Value with a Nested `_`

```rust 
fn main() {
    let mut setting_value = Some(5);
    let new_setting_value = Some(10);
    
    match (setting_value, new_setting_value) {
        (Some(_), Some(_)) => {
            println!("Can't overwrite an existing customized value");
        },
        _ => {
            setting_value = new_setting_value;
        }
    }
}
```



#### 16.3.6.3 Ignoring an Unused Variable by Starting its Name with `_`

```rust
fn main() {
    let _x = 5;
    let y = 10;
}
```



#### 16.3.6.4 Ignoring Remaining Parts of a Value with `..`

```rust
fn main() {
    let numbers = (2, 4, 8, 16, 32);
    
    match numbers {
        (first, .., last) => {
            println!("Some numbers: {first}, {last}");
        }
    }
}
```



### 16.3.7 Extra Conditionals with Match Guards

A *match guard* is an additional `if` condition, specified after the pattern in a `match` arm, that must also match for that arm to be chosen.

```rust
fn main() {
    let num = Some(4);
    
    match num {
        Some(x) if x % 2 == 0 => println!("The number {x} is even"),
        Some(x) => println!("The number {x} is odd"),
        None => (),
    }
}
```

Combining multiple patterns with a match guard:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 4;
    let y = false;

    match x {
        4 | 5 | 6 if y => println!("yes"),
        _ => println!("no"),  // hit here
    }
}
```

The match condition states that the arm only matches if the value of `x` is equal to `4`, `5`, or `6` and if `y` is `true`.

```rust
(4 | 5 | 6) if y => ...   // same as above

4 | 5 | (6 if y) => ...   
```



### 16.3.8 `@` Bindings

The *at* operator `@` lets us create a variable that holds a value at the same time as weâ€™re testing that value for a pattern match. 

```rust
fn main() {
    enum Message {
        Hello { id: i32 },
    }
    
    let msg = Message::Hello { id: 5 };
    
    match msg {
        Message::Hello {id: id_variable @ 3..=7 } => {
            println!("Found an id in range: {id_variable}");
        },
        Message::Hello { id: 10..=12 } => {
            println!("Found an id in another range");
        },
        Message::Hello { id } => println!("Found some other id: {id}"),
    }
}
```
