## 17.1 Unsafe Rust

### 17.1.1 Unsafe Superpowers

You can take five actions in unsafe Rust that you can't in safe Rust, which we call *unsafe superpower*:

- Dereference a raw pointer
- Call an unsafe function or method
- Access or modify a mutable static variable
- Implement an unsafe trait
- Access fields of a `union`

It's important to understand that `unsafe` doesn't turn off the borrow checker or disable any other of Rust's safety checks: if you use a reference in unsafe code, it will still be checked. The `unsafe` keyword only gives you access to these five features that are then not checked by the compiler for memory safety. You'll still get some degree of safety inside of an unsafe block.

In addition, `unsafe` does not mean the code inside the block is necessarily dangerous or that it will definitely have memory safety problems: the intent is that as the programmer, you'll ensure the code inside an `unsafe` block will access memory in a valid way.



### 17.1.2 Dereferencing a Raw Pointer

Unsafe Rust has two new types called *raw pointers* that are similar to references. As with references, raw pointers can be immutable or mutable and are written as `*const T` and `*mut T`, respectively. The asterisk isn't the dereference operator; it's part of the type name.

Different from references and smart pointers, raw pointers:

- Are allowed to ignore the borrowing rules by having both immutable and mutable pointers or multiple mutable pointers to the same location
- Aren't guaranteed to point to valid memory
- Are allowed to be null
- Don't implement any automatic cleanup

How to create an immutable and a mutable raw pointer from references:

```rust
let mut num = 5;

let r1 = &num as *const i32;
let r2 = &mut num as *mut i32; 
```

How to create a raw pointer to an arbitrary location in memory.

```rust
let address = 0x12345usize;
let r = address as *const i32;
```

We can create raw pointers in safe code, but we can't *dereference* raw pointers and read the data being pointed to. We use the dereference operator `*` on a raw pointer that read requires an `unsafe` block:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut num = 5;
    
    let r1 = &num as *const i32;
    let r2 = &mut num as *mut i32;
    
    unsafe {
        println!("r1 is {}", *r1);
        println!("r2 is {}", *r2);
    }
}
```



### 17.1.3 Calling an Unsafe Function or Method

Unsafe functions and methods look exactly like regular functions and methods, but they have an extra `unsafe` before the rest of the definition.

```rust
fn main() {
    unsafe fn dangerous() {}
    
    // must call it within a separate `unsafe` block
    unsafe {
        dangerous();
    }
}
```



#### 17.1.3.1 Creating a Safe Abstraction over Unsafe Code

Just because a function contains unsafe code doesn't mean we need to mark the entire function as unsafe. In fact, wrapping unsafe code in a safe function is a common abstraction.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
    
    let r = &mut v[..];
    
    let (a, b) = split_at_mut(r, 3);
    
    assert_eq!(a, &mut [1, 2, 3]);
    assert_eq!(b, &mut [4, 5, 6]);
}

fn split_at_mut(values: &mut [i32], mid: usize) -> (&mut [i32], &mut [i32]) {
    let len = values.len();
    
    assert!(mid <= len);
    
    (&mut values[..mid], &mut values[mid..])
}
```

When we try to compile the code, we'll get an error:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling unsafe-example v0.1.0 (E:\HHZ\gitee.com\elihe\learn-rust\13-unsafe\unsafe-example)

error: could not compile `unsafe-example` (bin "unsafe-example") due to previous error
```

Rust's borrow checker can't understand that we're borrowing different parts of the slice; it only knows that we're borrowing from the same slice twice. Borrowing different parts of the slice is fundamentally okay because the two slices aren't overlapping, but Rust isn't smart enough to know this.

How to use an `unsafe` block, a raw pointer, and some calls to unsafe functions to make the implementation of `split_at_mut` work.

```rust
use std::slice;

fn split_at_mut(values: &mut [i32], mid: usize) -> (&mut [i32], &mut [i32]) {
    let len = values.len();
    let ptr = values.as_mut_ptr();
    
    assert!(mid <= len);
    
    unsafe {
        (
            slice::from_raw_parts_mut(ptr, mid),
            slice::from_raw_parts_mut(ptr.add(mid), len - mid),
        )
    }
}
```

Some key points:

- `slice.as_mut_ptr()`: to access the raw pointer of a slice, it will returns a raw pointer with the type `*mut i32` here, which we've stored in the variable `ptr`.
- `slice::from_raw_parts_mut`: to take a raw pointer and a length, and it creates a slice that starts from `ptr` and is `mid` items long.



To create a slice from an arbitrary memory location:

```rust
use std::slice;

let address = 0x01234usize;
let r = address as *mut i32;

let values: &[i32] = unsafe { slice::from_raw_parts_mut(r, 10000) };
```



#### 17.1.3.2 Using `extern` Functions to Call External Code

Sometimes, Rust code might need to interact with code written in another language. For this, Rust has the keyword `extern` that facilitates the creation and use of a *Foreign Function Interface(FFI)*.

An FFI is a way for a programming language to define functions and enable a different (foreign) programming language to call those functions.

```rust
extern "C" {
    fn abs(input: i32) -> i32;
}

fn main() {
    unsafe {
        println!("Absolute value of -3 according to C: {}", abs(-3));
    }
}
```

Within the `extern "C"` block, we list the names and signatures of external function from another language we want to call. The `"C"` part defines which *application binary interface (ABI)* the external function uses: the ABI defines how to call the function at the assembly level. The `"C"` ABI is the most common and follows the C programming language's ABI.



#### 17.1.3.3 Calling Rust Functions from Other Languages

We add the `extern` keyword and specify the ABI to use just before the `fn` keyword for relevant function. We also need to add a `#[no_mangle]` annotation to tell the Rust compiler not to mangle the name of this function. *Mangling* is when a compiler changes the name we've given a function to a different name that contains more information for other parts of the compilation process to consume but is less human readable.

```rust
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn call_from_c() {
    println!("Just called a Rust function from C!");
}
```



### 17.1.4 Accessing or Modifying a Mutable Static Variable

In Rust, global variables are called *static variables*.

```rust
static HELLO_WORLD: &str = "Hello, world!";

fn main() {
    println!("name is {HELLO_WORLD}");
}
```



Static variables are similar to constants, it can only store references with the `static` lifetime, which means that Rust compiler can figure out the lifetime and we aren't required to annotate it explicitly. Accessing an immutable static variable is safe.

A subtle difference between constants and immutable static variables is that values in a static variable have a fixed address in memory. Using the value will always access the same data. Constants, on the other hand, are allowed to duplicate their data whenever they're used. Another difference is that static variables can be mutable. Accessing and modifying mutable static variables is unsafe.

```rust
static mut COUNTER: i32 = 0;

fn add_to_count(inc: i32) {
    unsafe {
        COUNTER += inc;
    }
}

fn main() {
    add_to_count(5);
    
    unsafe {
        println!("OUNTER: {COUNTER}");
    }
}
```



### 17.1.5 Implementing an Unsafe Trait

A trait is unsafe when at least one of its methods has some invariant that the compiler can't verify.

```rust
unsafe trait Foo {
    // methods go here
}

unsafe impl Foo for i32 {
    // method implementations go here
}

fn main() {}
```

By using `unsafe impl`, we're promising that we'll uphold the invariants that the compiler can't verify.



### 17.1.6 Accessing Fields of a Union

The final action that works only with `unsafe` is accessing fields of a *union*. A `union` is similar to a `struct`, but only one declared field is used in a particular instance at one tome. Unions are primarily used to interface with unions in C code. Accessing union fields is unsafe because Rust can't guarantee the type of the data currently being stored in the union instance.

 

## 17.2 Advanced Trait

### 17.2.1 Specifying Placeholder Types in Trait Definitions with Associated Types

*Associated types* connect a type placeholder with a trait such that the trait method definitions can use these placeholder types in their signatures. The implementor of a trait will specify the concrete type to be used instead of the placeholder type for the particular implementation. That way, we can define a trait that uses some types without needing to know exactly what those types are until the trait is implemented.

```rust
pub trait Iterator {
    type Item; // a associated type, stands in for the type of the values
    
    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item>;
}
```

An implementation of the `Iterator` trait on a type named `Counter` that specifies the `Item` type is `u32`:

```rust
impl Iterator for Counter {
    type Item = u32;
    
    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
        // --snip--
    }
}
```

A hypothetical definition of the `Iterator` trait using generics:

```rust
pub trait Iterator<T> {
    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<T>;
}
```



### 17.2.2 Default Generic Type Parameters and Operator Overloading

When we use generic type parameters, we can specify a default concrete type for the generic type. This eliminates the need for implementors of the trait to specify a concrete type if the default type works. You specify a default type when declaring a generic type with the `<PlaceholderType=ConcreteType>` syntax.

Rust doesn't allow you to create your own operators or overload arbitrary operators. But you can overload the operations and corresponding traits listed in `std::ops` by implementing the traits associated with the operator.

```rust
use std::ops::Add;

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq)]
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

impl Add for Point {
    type Output = Point;
    
    fn add(self, other: Point) -> Self::Output {
        Point {
            x: self.x + other.x,
            y: self.y + other.y,
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    assert_eq!(
        Point { x: 0, y: 2 } + Point { x: 5, y: 1 },
        Point { x: 5, y: 3 }
    );
}
```

The default generic type in this code is within the `Add` trait. Here is its defintion:

```rust
trait Add<Rhs=Self> {
    type Output;
    
    fn add(self, rhs: Rhs) -> Self::Output;
}
```

It looks generally familiar: a trait with one method and an  associated type. The new part is `Rhs=Self`: this syntax is called *default type parameters*. The `Rhs` generic type parameter (short for "right hand side") defines the type of the `rhs` parameter in the `add` method. If we don't specify a concrete type for `Rhs` when  we implement the `Add` trait, the type of `Rhs` will default to `Self`, which will be the type we're implementing `Add` on.



To add values in millimeters to values in meters and have the implementation `Add` do the conversion correctly.

```rust
use std::ops::Add;

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq)]
struct Millimeters(u32);

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq)]
struct Meters(u32);

impl Add<Meters> for Millimeters {
    type Output = Millimeters;
    
    fn add(self, other: Meters) -> Self::Output {
        Millimeters(self.0 + (other.0 * 1000))
    }
}

fn main() {
    assert_eq!(
        Millimeters(32) + Meters(1),
        Millimeters(1032)
    );
}
```



### 17.2.3 Fully Qualified Syntax for Disambiguation: Calling Methods with the Same Name

When calling methods with the same name, you'll need to tell Rust which one you want to use.

```rust
trait Polit {
    fn fly(&self);
}

trait Wizard {
    fn fly(&self);
}

struct Human;

impl Polit for Human {
    fn fly(&self) {
        println!("This is your captain speaking");
    }
}

impl Wizard for Human {
    fn fly(&self) {
        println!("Up");
    }
}

impl Human {
    fn fly(&self) {
        println!("*waving arms furiously*");
    }
}

fn main() {
    let person = Human;
    
    Polit::fly(&person);
    Wizard::fly(&person);
    
    person.fly();
    Human::fly(&person); // same as above
}
```



However, associated functions that are not methods don't have a `self` parameter. 

```rust
trait Animal {
    fn baby_name() -> String;
}

struct Dog;

impl Dog {
    fn baby_name() -> String {
        String::from("Spot")
    }
}

impl Animal for Dog {
    fn baby_name() -> String {
        String::from("puppy")
    }
}

fn main() {
    println!("A baby dog is called a {}", Dog::baby_name());  // Spot
    
    println!("A baby dog is called a {}", <Dog as Animal>::baby_name());  // puppy
}
```

In general, fully qualified syntax is defines as follows:

```rust
<Type as Trait>::function(receive_if_method, next_arg, ...);
```



### 17.2.4 Using Super-traits to Require One Trait's Functionality Within Another Trait

Sometimes, you might write a trait definition that depends on another trait: for a type to implement the first trait, you want to require that type to also implement the second trait. You would do this so that your trait definition can make use of the associated items of the second trait. The trait your trait definition is relying on is called a *super-trait* of your trait.

```rust
use std::fmt;

trait OutlinePrint: fmt::Display {
    fn outline_print(&self) {
        let output = self.to_string();
        let len = output.len();
        
        println!("{}", "*".repeat(len + 4));
        println!("*{}*", " ".repeat(len + 2));
        println!("* {output} *");
        println!("*{}*", " ".repeat(len + 2));
        println!("{}", "*".repeat(len + 4));
    }
}

struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

impl OutlinePrint for Point {}

fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 1, y: 5 };
    
    p.outline_print();
}
```

We get an error saying that `Display` is required but not implemented:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling trait-associated-operator v0.1.0 (E:\HHZ\gitee.com\elihe\learn-rust\04-trait\trait-associated-operator)

  --> src\main.rs:21:23
   |

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0277`.
error: could not compile `trait-associated-operator` (bin "trait-associated-operator") due to previous error
```

To fix this, we implement `Display` on `Point` and satisfy the constraint that `OutlinePrint` requires.

```rust
impl fmt::Display for Point {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        write!(f, "({}, {})", self.x, self.y)
    }
}
```



### 17.2.5 Using the Newtype Pattern to Implement External Traits on External Types

*Newtype* is a term that originates from the Haskell programming language. There is no runtime performance penalty for using this pattern, and the wrapper type is elide at compile time.

To implement `Display` on `Vec<T>`, which the orphan rule prevents us from doing directly because the `Display` trait and the `Vec<T>` type are defined outside our crate. We can make a `Wrapper` struct that holds an instance of `Vec<T>`; then we can implement `Display` on `Wrapper` and use the `Vec<T>` value.

```rust
use std::fmt;

struct Wrapper(Vec<String>);

impl fmt::Display for Wrapper {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        write!(f, "[{}]", self.0.join(", "))
    }
}

fn main() {
    let w = Wrapper(vec![String::from("Hello"), String::from("World")]);
    
    println!("w = {w}");
}
```



## 17.3 Advanced Types

### 17.3.1 Using the Newtype Pattern for Type Safety and Abstraction

The newtype pattern: 

- to abstract away some implementation details of a type: the new type can expose a public API that is different from the API of the private inner type.
- to hide internal implementation. 



### 17.3.2 Creating Type Synonyms with Type Aliases

To declare a *type alias* to give an existing type another name:

```rust
type Kilometers = i32;

fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 5;
    let y: Kilometers = 6;

    println!("x + y = {}", x + y);
}
```

Because `Kilometers` and `i32` are the same type, we can add values of both types and we can pass `Kilometers` values to functions that take `i32` parameters.

The main use case for type synonyms is to reduce repetition. For example, we might have a lengthy type like this:

```rust
Box<dyn Fn() + Send + 'static>
```

Writing this lengthy type in function signatures and as type annotations all over the code can be tiresome and error phone. Imagine having a project full of code this:

```rust
let f: Box<dyn Fn() + Send + 'static> = Box::new(|| println!("hi"));

fn takes_long_type(f: Box<dyn Fn() + Send + 'static>) {
    // --snip--
}

fn returns_long_type() -> Box<dyn Fn() + Send + 'static> {
    // --snip--
}
```

A type alias makes this code more manageable by reducing the repetition. 

```rust
type Thunk = Box<dyn Fn() + Send + 'static>;

let f: Thunk = Box::new(|| println!("hi"));

fn takes_long_type(f: Thunk) {
    // --snip--
}

fn returns_long_type() -> Thunk {
    // --snip--
}
```

Type aliases are also commonly used with the `Result<T, E>` type for reducing repetition.

```rust
use std::fmt;
use std::io::Error;

pub trait Write {
    fn write(&mut self, buf: &[u8]) -> Result<usize, Error>;
    fn flush(&mut self) -> Result<(), Error>;
    
    fn write_all(&mut self, buf: &[u8]) -> Result<(), Error>;
    fn write_fmt(&mut self, fmt: fmt::Arguments) -> Result<(), Error>;
}
```

The `Result<..., Error>` is repeated a lot. As such, `std::io` has this type alias declaration:

```rust
type Result<T> = std::result::Result<T, std::io::Error>;

pub trait Write {
    fn write(&mut self, buf: &[u8]) -> Result<usize>;
    fn flush(&mut self) -> Result<()>;
    
    fn write_all(&mut self, buf: &[u8]) -> Result<()>;
    fn write_fmt(&mut self, fmt: fmt::Arguments) -> Result<()>;
}
```



### 17.3.3 The Never Type that Never Returns

Rust has a special type named `!` that's known in type theory lingo as the *empty type* because it has no values. We prefer to call it the *never type* because it stands in the place of the return type when a function will never return.

```rust
// return never
fn bar() -> ! {
    // --snip--
}
```

Functions that return never are called *diverging functions*

 `continue` has a `!` value:

```rust
        let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
            Ok(num) => num,
            Err(_) => continue,
        };
```



The never type is useful with the `panic!` marco as well. Recall the `unwrap` function that we call on `Option<T>` values to produce a value or panic with this definition:

```rust
impl<T> Option<T> {
    pub fn unwrap(self) -> T {
        match self {
            Some(val) => val,
            None => panic!("called `Option::unwrap()` on  a `None` value"),
        }
    }
}
```

One final expression that has the type `!` is a `loop`:

```rust
print!("forever ");

loop {
    print!("and ever ");
}
```



### 17.3.4 Dynamically Sized Types and the `Sized` Trait

The *dynamically sized types*, referred to as DSTs or *unsized types*, these types let us write code using values whose size we can know only at runtime.

The `str` is a DST, but not `&str`.  We can't know how long the string is until runtime, meaning we can't create a variable of type `str`, nor can we take an argument of type `str`.

The following code does not work:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1: str = "Hello there!";
    let s2: str = "How is it going?";
    
    println!("{s1}, {s2}");
}
```

Get an error:

```bash
 Compiling playground v0.0.1 (/playground)
error[E0308]: mismatched types
 --> src/main.rs:2:19
  |
2 |     let s1: str = "Hello there!";
  |             ---   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected `str`, found `&str`
  |             |
  |             expected due to this
```

A `&str` is two values: the address of the `str` and its length. As such, we can know the size of a `&str` value at compile tome: it's twice the length of a `usize`/

The golden rule of dynamically sized types is that we must always put values of dynamically sized types behind a pointer of some kind.

We can combine `str` with all kinds of pointers: for example, `Box<str>` or `Rc<str>`.

To work with DSTs, Rust provides the `Sized` trait to determine whether or not a type's size is known at compile time. This trait is automatically implemented for everything whose size is known at compile time. In addition, Rust implicitly adds a bound on `Sized` to every generic function.

```rust
fn generic<T>(t: T) {
    // --snip--
}
```

is actually treated as though we had written this:

```rust
fn generic<T: Sized>(t: T) {
    // --snip--
}
```

By default, generic functions will work only on types that have a known size at compile time. However, you can use the following special syntax to relax this restriction:

```rust
fn generic<T: ?Sized>(t: &T) {
    // --snip--
}
```

A trait bound on `?Sized` means "`T` may or may not be `Sized`" and this notation overrides the default that generic types must have a known size at compile time. The `?Trait` syntax with this meaning is only available for `Sized`, not any other trait.

Also note that we switched the type of the `t` parameter from `T` to `&T`. Because the type might not be `Sized`, we need to use it behind some kind of pointer. In this case, we've chosen a reference.



## 17.4 Advanced Functions and Closures

### 17.4.1 Function Pointers

Functions coerce to the type `fn`, not to be confused with the `Fn` closure trait. The `fn` type is called a *function pointer*. Passing functions with function pointers will allow you to use functions as arguments to other functions.

```rust
fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}

fn do_twice(f: fn(i32) -> i32, arg: i32) -> i32 {
    f(arg) + f(arg)
}

fn main() {
    let answer = do_twice(add_one, 3);

    println!("The answer is: {answer}");
}
```

Unlike closures, `fn` is a type rather than a trait, so we specify `fn` as the parameter type directly rather than declaring a generic type parameter with one of the `Fn` traits as a trait bound.

Function pointer implement all three of the closure traits (`Fn`, `FnMnt`, and `FnOnce`), meaning you can always pass a function pointer as an argument for a function that expects a closure. It's best to write functions using a generic type and one of the closure traits so your functions can accept either functions or closures.

To use the `map` function to turn a vector of numbers into a vector of strings, we could use a closure, like this:

```rust
let list_of_numbers = vec![1, 2, 3];
let list_of_strings: Vec<String> = 
    list_of_numbers.iter().map(|i| i.to_string()).collect();
```

Or we could name a function as the argument to `map` instead of the closure, like this:

```rust 
let list_of_numbers = vec![1, 2, 3];
let list_of_strings: Vec<String> = 
    list_of_numbers.iter().map(ToString::to_string).collect();
```

We can use these initializer functions as function pointers that implement the closure traits, which means we can specify the initializer functions as arguments for methods that take closures, like so:

```rust
fn main() {
    #[derive(Debug)]
    enum Status {
        Value(u32),
        Stop,
    }
    
    let list_of_statuses: Vec<Status> = (0u32..20).map(Status::Value).collect();

    println!("{list_of_statuses:?}");
}
```



### 17.4.2 Returning Closures

Closures are represented by traits, which means you can't return closures directly. In most cases where you might want to return a trait, you can instead use the concrete type that implements the trait as the return value of the function. However, you can't do that with closures because they don't have a concrete type that is returnable; you're not allowed to use the function pointer `fn` as a return type.

```rust
fn return_closure() -> dyn Fn(i32) -> i32 {
    |x| x + 1
}
```

This code will get an error:

```bash
error[E0746]: return type cannot have an unboxed trait object
  --> src/main.rs:13:24
   |
13 | fn return_closure() -> dyn Fn(i32) -> i32 {
   |                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ doesn't have a size known at compile-time
   |
help: return an `impl Trait` instead of a `dyn Trait`, if all returned values are the same type
   |
13 | fn return_closure() -> impl Fn(i32) -> i32 {
   |                        ~~~~
help: box the return type, and wrap all of the returned values in `Box::new`
   |
13 ~ fn return_closure() -> Box<dyn Fn(i32) -> i32> {
14 ~     Box::new(|x| x + 1)
   |
```



The error references the `Sized` trait again! Rust doesn't know how much space it will need to store the closure. We can use a trait object:

```rust
fn return_closure() -> Box<dyn Fn(i32) -> i32> {
    Box::new(|x| x + 1)
}
```



## 17.5 Macros

The term *macro* refers to a family of features in Rust: *declarative* macros with `macro_rules!` and three kinds of *procedural* macros:

- Custom `#[derive]` macros that specify code added with the `derive` attribute used on structs and enums
- Attribute-like macros that define custom attributes usable on any item
- Function-like macros that look like function calls but operate on the tokens specified as their argument



### 17.5.1 The Difference Between Macros and Functions

Fundamentally, macros are a way of writing code that writes other code, which is known as *meta-programming*. 

Meta-programming is useful for reducing the amount of code you have to write and maintain, which is also one of the roles of functions. However, macros have some additional powers that functions don't.

A function signature must declare the number and type of parameters the function has. Macros, on the other hand, can take a variable number of parameters: we can call `println!("hello")` with one argument or `println!("hello {}", name)` with two arguments. Also, macros are expanded before the compiler interprets the meaning of the code, so a macro can, for example, implement a trait on a given type. A function can't, because it gets called at runtime and a trait needs to be implemented at compile time.

The downside to implementing a macro instead of a function is that macro definition are more complex than function definitions because you're writing Rust code that writes Rust code. Due to this indirection, macro definitions are generally more difficult to read, understand, and maintain than function definitions.

Another important difference between macros and functions is that you must define macros or bring them into scope *before* you call them in a file, as opposed to functions you can define anywhere and call anywhere.



### 17.5.2 Declarative Macros with `macro_rules!` for General Meta-programming

The following macro creates a new vector containing three integers:

```rust
let v: Vec<u32> = vec![1, 2, 3];
```

To define a macro, you use the `macro_rules!` construct. A slightly simplified definition of the `vec!` macro:

```rust
#[macro_export]
macro_rules! vec {
    ( $( $x:expr ),* ) => {
        {
            let mut temp_vec = Vec::new();
            $(
            	temp_vec.push($x);
            )*
            temp_vec
        }
    };
}
```

The key points about defining a macro:

- The `#[macro_export]` annotation indicates that this macro should be made available whenever the crate in which the macro is defined is brought into scope.

- Starting the macro definition with `macro_rules!` and the name of the macro we're defining *without* the exclamation mark. The name, in this case `vec`, is followed by curly brackets denoting the body of the macro definition.
- The structure in the `vec!` body is similar to the structure of a `match` expression. Here we have one arm with the pattern `( $( $x:expr ),* )`, followed by `=>` and the block of code associated with the pattern. If the pattern matches, the associated block of code will be emitted. Given that this is the only pattern in this macro, there is only one valid way to match; any other pattern will result in an error. More complex macro will have more than one arm.
  - use a set of parentheses to encompass the whole pattern.
  - use a dollar sign (`$`) to declare a variable in the macro system that will contain the Rust code matching the pattern, this dollar sign makes it clear this is a macro variable as opposed to a regular Rust variable.
  - next comes a set of parentheses that captures values that match the pattern within the parentheses for use in the replacement code.
  - within `$()` is `$x:expr`, which matches any Rust expression and gives the expression the name `$x`
  - the comma following `$()` indicates that a literal comma separator character could optionally appear after the code that matches the code in `$()`, the `*` specifies that the pattern matches zero or more of whatever precedes the `*`.
  - the pattern in the body of the code associated with this arm: `temp_vec.push()` within `$()*` is generated for each part that matches `$()` in the pattern zero or more times depending on how many times the pattern matches. the `$x` is replaced with each expression matched. 

When we call this macro with `vec![1, 2, 3]`; the code generated that replaces this macro call will be the following:

```rust
{
    let mut temp_vec = Vec::new();
    temp_vec.push(1);
    temp_vec.push(2);
    temp_vec.push(3);
    temp_vec
}
```



### 17.5.3 Procedural Macros for Generating Code from Attributes

The second form of macros is the *procedural macro*, which acts more like a function (and is a type of procedure). Procedural macros accept some code as an input, operate on  that code, and produce some code as an output rather than matching against patterns and replacing the code with other code as declarative macros do. The three kinds of procedural macros are custom derive, attribute-like, and function-like, and all work in a similar fashion.

To define a procedural macro, where `some_attribyte` is a placeholder for using a specific macro variety.

```rust
use proc_macro;

#[some_attribute]
pub fn some_name(input: TokenStream) -> TokenStream {
    
}
```

The function that defines a procedural macro takes a `TokenStream` as  an input and produces a `TokenStream` as an output. The `TokenStream` type is defined by the `proc_macro` crate that is included with Rust and represents a sequence of tokens. This is the core of the macro: the source code that the macro is operating on makes up the input `TokenStream`, and the code the macro produces is the output `TokenStream`. The function also has an attribute attached to it that specifies which kind of procedural macro we're creating. We can have multiple kinds of procedural macros in the same crate.



### 17.5.4 How to Write a Custom `derive` Macro

#### 17.5.4.1 hello

```bash
$ cargo new hello
     Created binary (application) `hello` package
```

`Cargo.toml`

```toml
[dependencies]
hello_macro = { path = "../hello_macro" }
hello_macro_derive = { path = "../hello_macro/hello_macro_derive" }
```

`src/main.rs`

```rust
use hello_macro::HelloMacro;
use hello_macro_derive::HelloMacro;

#[derive(HelloMacro)]
struct Pancakes;

fn main() {
    Pancakes::hello_macro();
}
```



#### 17.5.4.2 hello_macro

```bash
$ cargo new hello_macro --lib
     Created library `hello_macro` package
```

`src/lib.rs`

```rust
pub trait HelloMacro {
    fn hello_macro();
}
```



#### 17.5.4.3 hello_macro_derive

```bash
$ cd hello_macro
$ cargo new hello_macro_derive --lib
     Created library `hello_macro_derive` package
```

`Cargo.toml`

```toml
[lib]
proc-macro = true

[dependencies]
syn = "2.0"
quote = "1.0"
```

`src/lib.rs`

```rust
use proc_macro::TokenStream;
use quote::quote;
use syn;

#[proc_macro_derive(HelloMacro)]
pub fn hello_macro_derive(input: TokenStream) -> TokenStream {
    // Construct a representation of Rust code as a syntax tree
    // that we can manipulate
    let ast = syn::parse(input).unwrap();
    
    // Build the trait implementation
    impl_hello_macro(&ast)
}

fn impl_hello_macro(ast: &syn::DeriveInput) -> TokenStream {
    let name = &ast.ident;
    let gen = quote! {
        impl HelloMacro for #name {
            fn hello_macro() {
                println!("Hello, Macro! My name is {}!", stringify!(#name));
            }
        }
    };
    gen.into()
}
```



### 17.5.5 Attribute-like macros

Attribute-like macros are similar to custom derive macros, but instead of generating code for the `derive` attribute, they allow you to create new attributes. They're also more flexible: `derive` only works for structs and enums; attributes can be applied to other items as well, such as functions.

Here's an example of using an attribute-like macro: say you have an attribute named `route` that annotates functions when using a web application framework:

```rust
#[route(GET, "/")]
fn index() {
    
}
```

This `#[route]` attribute would be defined by the framework as a procedural macro. The signature of the macro definition function would look like this:

```rust
#[proc_macro_attribute]
pub fn route(attr: TokenStream, item: TokenStream) -> TokenStream {
    
}
```



### 17.5.6 Function-like macros

Function-like macros define macros that look like function calls.

Function-like macros take a `TokenStream` parameter and their definition manipulates that `TokenStream` using Rust code as the other two types of procedural macros do.

An example of a function-like macro is an `sql!` macro that be called like so:

```rust 
let sql = sql!(SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id=1);
```

This macro would parse SQL statement inside it and check that it's syntactically correct, which is much more complex processing than a `macro_rules!` macro can do.

```rust
#[proc_macro]
pub fn sql(input: TokenStream) -> TokenStream {
    
}
```
