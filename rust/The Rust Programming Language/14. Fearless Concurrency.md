# 14. Fearless Concurrency

## 14.1 Using Threads to Run Code Simultaneously

The multiple threads can lead to problem, such as:

- Race conditions, where threads are accessing data or resources in an inconsistent order
- Deadlocks, where two threads are waiting for each other, preventing both threads from continuing
- Bugs that happen only in certain situations and are hard to reproduce and fix reliably



### 14.1.1 Creating a New Thread with `spawn`

The `thread::spawn` function takes in a closure containing the code you want to run in the new thread.

```rust  
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    thread::spawn(|| {
        for i in 1..10 {
            println!("hi number {i} from the spawned thread!");
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1));
        }
    });
    
    for i in 1..5 {
        println!("hi number {i} from the main thread!");
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1));
    }
}
```



### 14.1.2 Waiting for All Threads to Finish Using `join` Handles

The return type of `thread::spawn` is `JoinHandle`, it is an owned value that, when we call the `join` method on it, will wait for its thread to finish.

```rust
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    let handle = thread::spawn(|| {
        for i in 1..10 {
            println!("hi number {i} from the spawned thread!");
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1));
        }
    });
    
    for i in 1..5 {
        println!("hi number {i} from the main thread!");
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1));
    }
    
    handle.join().unwrap();
}
```



### 14.1.3 Using `move` Closures with Threads

Use the `move` keyword with closures passed to `thread::spawn` because the closure will then take ownership of the values it uses form the environment, thus transferring ownership of those values from one thread to another.

```rust
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
    
    let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
        println!("Here is a vector: {v:?}");
    });
    
    handle.join().unwrap();
}
```



## 14.2 Using Message Passing to Transfer Data Between Threads

Here's the idea in a slogan from the Go language: "Do not communicate by sharing memory; instead, share memory by communicating".

To accomplish message-sending concurrency, Rust's standard library provides an implementation of *channels*. A channel is a general programming concept by which data is sent from one thread to another.

We create a new channel using the `mpsc::channel` function; `mpsc` stands for *multiple producer, single consumer*.

The `mpsc::channel` function returns a tuple, the first element of which is the sending end -- the transmitter -- and the second element is the receiving end -- the receiver.

```rust
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();
    
    thread::spawn(move || {
        let val = String::from("hi");
        tx.send(val).unwrap();
        //println!("val is {val}"); // value borrowed here after move
    });
    
    let received = rx.recv().unwrap();
    println!("Got: {received}");
}
```



### 14.2.1 Sending Multiple Values and Seeing the Receiver Waiting

```rust
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();
    
    thread::spawn(move || {
        let vals = vec![
            String::from("hi"),
            String::from("from"),
            String::from("the"),
            String::from("thread"),
        ];
        
        for val in vals {
            tx.send(val).unwrap();
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1));
        }
    });
    
    for received in rx {
        println!("Got: {received}");
    }
}
```



### 14.2.2 Creating Multiple Producers by Cloning the Transmitter

To create multiple threads that all send values to the same receiver. We can do so by cloning the transmitter.

```rust
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();
    
    let tx1 = tx.clone();
    thread::spawn(move || {
        let vals = vec![
            String::from("hi"),
            String::from("from"),
            String::from("the"),
            String::from("thread"),
        ];
        
        for val in vals {
            tx1.send(val).unwrap();
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1));
        }
    });
    
    thread::spawn(move || {
        let vals = vec![
            String::from("more"),
            String::from("message"),
            String::from("for"),
            String::from("you"),
        ];
        
        for val in vals {
            tx.send(val).unwrap();
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1));
        }
    });
    
    
    for received in rx {
        println!("Got: {received}");
    }
}
```



## 14.3 Shared-State Concurrency

### 14.3.1 Using Mutexes to Allow Access to Data from One Thread at a Time

*Mutex* is an abbreviation for *mutual exclusion*, as in , a mutex allows only one thread to access some data at any given time.

Mutexes have a reputation for being difficult to use because you have to remember two rules:

-  You must attempt to acquire the lock before using the data.
- When you're done with the data that the mutex guards, you must unlock the data so other threads can acquire the lock.



#### 14.3.1.1 The API of `Mutex<T>`

```rust
use std::sync::Mutex;

fn main() {
    let m = Mutex::new(5);
    
    {
        let mut num = m.lock().unwrap();
        *num = 6;
    }
    
    println!("m: {m:?}");
}
```



#### 14.3.1.2 Sharing a `Mutex<T>` Between Multiple Threads

```rust
use std::sync::Mutex;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let counter = Mutex::new(0);
    let mut handles = vec![];
    
    for _ in 0..10 {
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            let mut num = counter.lock().unwrap();
            *num += 1;
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }
    
    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }
    
    println!("Result: {}", *counter.lock().unwrap());
}
```



To compile the code, and catch this error:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling shared-state v0.1.0 (E:\HHZ\gitee.com\elihe\learn-rust\11-system-schedule\01-thread\shared-state)

#### 14.3.1.3 Multiple Ownership with Multiple Threads

We gave a value multiple owners by using the smart pointer `Rc<T>` to create a reference counted value. We'll wrap the `Mutex<T>` in `Rc<T>` and clone the `Rc<T>` before moving ownership to the thread.

```rust
use std::sync::Mutex;
use std::thread;
use std::rc::Rc;

fn main() {
    let counter = Rc::new(Mutex::new(0));
    let mut handles = vec![];
    
    for _ in 0..10 {
        let counter = Rc::clone(&counter);
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            let mut num = counter.lock().unwrap();
            *num += 1;
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }
    
    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }
    
    println!("Result: {}", *counter.lock().unwrap());
}
```



Once again, we compile and get different errors:

```bash

```

Here's the important part to focus on :`Rc<Mutex<i32>> cannot be sent between threads safely` . The compiler is also telling us the reason why: `the trait Send is not implemented for Rc<Mutex<i32>>`. The `Send` trait is one of the traits that ensures the types we use with threads are meant for use in concurrent situations.

Unfortunately, `Rc<T>` is not safe to share across threads. When `Rc<T>` manages the reference count, it adds to the count for each call to `clone` and substracts from the count when each clone is dropped.



#### 14.3.1.4 Atomic Reference Counting with `Arc<T>`

Fortunately, `Arc<T>` is a type like `Rc<T>` that is safe to use in concurrent situations. The *a* stands for *atomic*, meaning it's an *atomically reference counted* type.

```rust 
use std::sync::{Mutex, Arc};
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let counter = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0));
    let mut handles = vec![];
    
    for _ in 0..10 {
        let counter = Arc::clone(&counter);
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            let mut num = counter.lock().unwrap();
            *num += 1;
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }
    
    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }
    
    println!("Result: {}", *counter.lock().unwrap());
}
```



### 14.3.2 Similarities Between `RefCell<T> & Rc<T>` and `Mutex<T>  & Arc<T>`

`RefCell<T>` provides interior mutability, as the `Cell` family does. In the same way we used `RefCell<T>` allow us to mutate contents inside an `Rc<T>`, we use `Mutex<T>` to mutate contents inside an `Arc<T>`

Using `Rc<T>` came with the risk of creating reference cycles, where two `Rc<T>` values refer to each other, causing memory leaks.

Similarly, `Mutex<T>` comes with the risk of creating *deadlock*. These occur when an operation needs to lock two resources and two threads have each acquired one of the locks, causing them to wait for each other forever.



## 14.4 Extensible Concurrency with the `Sync` and `Send` Traits

The `std::marker` traits `Sync` and `Send`



### 14.4.1 Allowing Transference of Ownership Between Threads with `Send`

The `Send` marker trait indicates that ownership of values of the type implementing `Send` can be transferred between threads.

Almost every Rust type is `Send`, but there some exceptions, including `Rc<T>`: this cannot be `Send` because if you cloned an `Rc<T>` value and tried to transfer ownership of the clone to another thread, both threads might update the reference count at the same time. For this reason, `Rc<T>` is implemented for us in single-threaded situations where you don't want to pay the thread-safe performance penalty.

Any type composed entirely of `Send` types is automatically marked as `Send` as well. Almost all primitive types are `Send`, aside from raw pointers.



### 14.4.2 Allowing Access from Multiple Threads with `Sync`

The `Sync` marker trait indicates that it is safe for the type implementing `Sync` to be referenced from multiple threads. In other words, any type `T` is `Sync` if `&T` (an immutable reference to `T`) is `Send`, meaning the reference can be sent safely to another thread. Similar to `Send`, primitive types are `Sync`, and types composed entirely of types that are `Sync` are also `Sync`.

The smart pointer `Rc<T>` is also not `Sync` for the same reasons that it’s not `Send`. The `RefCell<T>` type and the family of related `Cell<T>` types are not `Sync`. The implementation of borrow checking that `RefCell<T>` does at runtime is not thread-safe. The smart pointer `Mutex<T>` is `Sync` and can be used to share access with multiple threads.



### 14.4.3 Implementing `Send` and `Sync` Manually is Unsafe

Because types that are made up of `Send` and `Sync` traits are automatically also `Send` and `Sync`, we don’t have to implement those traits manually. As marker traits, they don’t even have any methods to implement. They’re just useful for enforcing invariants related to concurrency.

Manually implementing these traits involves implementing unsafe Rust code. Building new concurrent types not made up of `Send` and `Sync` parts requires careful thought to uphold the safety guarantees.
