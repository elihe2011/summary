# 12. Crate and Crate.io

## 12.1 Customizing Builds with Release Profiles

Cargo has two main profiles: 

- `dev` : when you run `cargo build`, for development.
- `release`: when you run `cargo build --release`, for release builds.

```bash
$ cargo build
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0s
$ cargo build --release
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.0s
```



Here are the default values for the `opt-level` setting for the `dev` and `release` profiles in the configuration file `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[profile.dev]
opt-level = 0

[profile.release]
opt-level = 3
```

The `opt-level` setting controls the number of optimizations Rust will apply to your code, with a rang of 0 to 3.



## 12.2 Publishing a Crate to Crates.io

### 12.2.1 Making Useful Documentation Comments

Filename: `src/lib.rs`

```rust
/// Adds one to the number given.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// let arg = 5;
/// let answer = my_crate::add_one(arg);
///
/// assert_eq(6, answer);
/// ```
pub fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}
```

To generate the HTML documentation from this documentation comment by running `cargo doc` , this command runs the `rustdoc` tool distributed with Rust and puts the generated HTML documentation in the *target/doc* directory.

```bash
$ cargo doc
 Documenting my_crate v0.1.0 (E:\HHZ\gitee.com\elihe\learn-rust\16-project\my_crate)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.11s

```



#### 12.2.1.1 Commonly Used Sections

Here are some other sections that crate authors commonly use in their documentation:

- **Panics**: The scenarios in which the function being documented could panic. Callers of the function who don't want their programs to panic should make sure the don't call the function in these situations.
- **Errors**: If the function returns a `Result`, describing the kinds of errors that might occur and what conditions might cause those errors to be returned can be helpful to callers so they can write code to handle the different kinds of errors in different ways.
- **Safety**: if the function is `unsafe` to call, there should be a section explaining why the function is unsafe and covering the invariants that function expects callers to uphold.



#### 12.2.1.2 Documentation Comments as Tests

```rust
$ cargo test
...
   Doc-tests my_crate

running 1 test
test src\lib.rs - add_one (line 5) ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.23s
```



#### 12.2.1.3 Commenting Contained Items

The style of doc comment `//!` adds documentation to the item contains the comments rather than to the items following the comments.

```rust
//! # My Crate
//!
//! `my_crate` is a collection of utilities to make performing certain
//! calculations more convenient.

/// Adds one to the number given.
// --snip--
```



### 12.2.2 Exporting a Convenient Public API with pub use

Filename: `src/lib.rs`

```rust
//! # Art
//!
//! A library for modeling artistic concepts.

pub mod kinds {
    /// The primary colors according to the RYB color model.
    pub enum PrimaryColor {
        Red,
        Yellow,
        Blue,
    }
    
    // The secondary colors according to the RYB color model.
    pub enum SecondaryColor {
        Orange,
        Green,
        Purple,
    }
}

pub mod utils {
    use crate::kinds::*;
    
    /// Combines two primary colors in equal amounts to crate
    /// a secondary color.
    pub fn mix(c1: PrimaryColor, c2: PrimaryColor) -> SecondaryColor {
        // --snip--
    }
}
```

Filename: `src/main.rs`

```rust
use art::kinds::PrimaryColor;
use art::utils::mix;

fn main() {
    let red = PrimaryColor::Red;
    let yellow = PrimaryColor::Yellow;
    mix(red, yellow);
}
```



To remove the internal organization from the public API, add `pub use` statement to re-export the items at the top level:

```rust
//! # Art
//!
//! A library for modeling artistic concepts.

pub use self::kinds::PrimaryColor;
pub use self::kinds::SecondaryColor;
pub use self::utils::mix;

pub mod kinds {
    --snip--
}

pub mod utils {
    --snip--
}
```

The `art` crate users can still see and use the internal structure.

```rust
use art::mix;
use art::PrimaryColor;

fn main() {
    --snip--
}
```



### 12.2.3 Setting Up a Crates.io Account

Visit your account settings at https://crates.io/me/ and retrieve your API key, then run the `cargo login` command and paste your API key when prompted:

```bash
$ cargo login
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz012345
```

This command will inform Cargo of your API token and store it locally in `~/.cargo/credentials`



### 12.2.4 Adding Metadata to a New Crate

```toml
[package]
name = "guessing_game"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
description = "A fun game where you guess what number the computer has chosen."
license = "MIT OR Apache-2.0"

[dependencies]
```



### 12.2.5 Publishing to Crates.io

Be careful, because a publish is *permanent*. The version can never be overwritten, and the code cannot be deleted. 

```bash
$ cargo publish
    Updating crates.io index
   Packaging guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)
   Verifying guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)
   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0
(file:///projects/guessing_game/target/package/guessing_game-0.1.0)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.19s
   Uploading guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)
```

Use the **Semantic Versioning rules** to decide what an appropriate next version number is based on the kinds of change you've made.

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

- MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
- MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- PATCH version when you make backward compatible bug fixes



### 12.2.6 Deprecating Versions from Crates.io with cargo yank

Yanking a version prevents new projects from depending on that version while allowing all existing projects that depend on it to continue. Essentially, a yank means that all projects with a Cargo.lock will not break, and any future Cargo.lock files generated will not use the yanked version.

```bash
$ cargo yank --vers 1.0.1
    Updating crates.io index
        Yank guessing_game@1.0.1
        
$ cargo yank --vers 1.0.1 --undo
    Updating crates.io index
      Unyank guessing_game@1.0.1
```



## 12.3 Cargo Workspaces

### 12.3.1 Creating a Workspace

A workspace is a set of packages that **share the same `Cargo.lock` and output directory.**

**Step-1**. To create a new directory for the workspace:

```bash
$ mkdir add

$ cd add
```



**Step-2**: To create the `Cargo.toml` file that will configure the entire workspace. This file won't have a `[package]` section, instead, it will start with a `[workspace]` section that will allow us to add members to the workspace by specifying the path to the package with our binary crate.

```toml
[workspace]
members = [
	"adder",
	"add_one",
]
```



**Step-3**: To create the crates

```bash
$ cargo new adder
     
$ cargo new add_one --lib

$ tree
.
├── Cargo.toml
├── add_one
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── src
│       └── lib.rs
└── adder
    ├── Cargo.toml
    └── src
        └── main.rs
```



**Step-4**: In the `add_one/src/lib.rs`, adding an `add_one` function

```rust
pub fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}
```



**Step-5**: To add a path dependency on `add_one` to `adder/Cargo.toml`

```toml
[dependencies]
add_one = { path = "../add_one" }
```



**Step-6**: To call `add_one` function in `adder/src/main.go`

```rust
use add_one;

fn main() {
    let num = 10;
    println!("{num} plus one is {}", add_one::add_one(num));
}
```



**Step-7**: To build the workspace by running `cargo build` in the top-level add directory.

```bash
$ cargo build
   Compiling add_one v0.1.0 (E:\HHZ\gitee.com\elihe\learn-rust\16-project\add\add_one)
   Compiling adder v0.1.0 (E:\HHZ\gitee.com\elihe\learn-rust\16-project\add\adder)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.49s
```

To run the binary crate from the add directory, we can specify which package in the workspace we want to run by using the `-p` argument:

```bash
$ cargo run
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.02s
     Running `target\debug\adder.exe`
10 plus one is 11

$ cargo run -p adder
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.04s
     Running `target\debug\adder.exe`
10 plus one is 11
```



### 12.3.2 Depending on an External Package in a Workspace

```toml
[dependencies]
rand = "0.8.5"
```



### 12.3.3 Adding a Test to Workspace

Filename: `add_one/src/lib.rs`

```rust
pub fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    
    #[test]
    fn it_works() {
        assert_eq!(3, add_one(2));
    }
}
```



To run the tests:

```bash
# for all the crates in the workspace
$ cargo test

# specifying the name of the crate
cargo test -p add_one
```
