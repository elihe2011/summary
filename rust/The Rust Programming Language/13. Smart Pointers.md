# 13. Smart Pointers

Smart pointers, in the other hand, are data structures that act like a pointer but also have additional metadata and capabilities.

Smart pointer are usually implemented using structs. Unlike an ordinary struct, smart pointers implement the `Deref` and `Drop` traits.

The `Deref` trait allows an instance of the smart pointer struct to be behave like a reference so you can write your code work with either references or smart pointers.

The `Drop` trait allows you to customize the code that's run when an instance of smart pointer goes out of scope.

The most common smart pointers in the standard library:

- `Box<T>` for allocating values on the heap
- `Rc<T>` , a reference counting type that enables multiple ownership
- `Ref<T>` and `RefMut<T>`, accessed through `RefCell<T>`, a type that enforces the borrowing rules at runtime instead of compile time



## 13.1 Using `Box<T>` to Point to Data on the Heap

Boxes don't have performance overhead, other than storing their data on the heap instead of on the stack. But they don't have many extra capabilities either. You'll use them most often in these situations:

- When you have a type whose **size can't be known at compile time** and you want to use a value of that type in a context that **requires an exact size**.
- When you **have a large amount of data and you want to transfer ownership** but ensure the data won't be copied when you do so.
- When you want to own a value and you cate only that it's a type that implements a particular trait rather than being of a specific type.



### 13.1.1 Using a `Box<T>` to Store Data on the Heap

```rust
fn main() {
    let b = Box::new(5);
    println!("b = {b}");
}
```



### 13.1.2 Enabling Recursive Types with Boxes

The nesting of values of recursive types could theoretically continue infinitely, so Rust can't know how much the values needs. Because boxes have a known size, we can enable recursive types by inserting a box in the recursive type definition.

#### 13.1.2.1 More Information About the Cons List

A **cons**(short for "construct function") **list** is a data structure that comes from the Lisp programming language and its dialects and is made up of nested pairs, and is the Lisp version of a linked list. 

Here's a pseudocode representation of cons list containing the list 1, 2, 3 with each pair in parentheses:

```
(1, (2, (3, Nil)))
```

To define a cons list in Rust:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
enum List {
    Cons(i32, List),
    Nil,
}

use crate::List::{Cons, Nil};

fn main() {
    // recursive type `List` has infinite size
    let list = Cons(1, Cons(2, Cons(3, Nil)));
    
    println!("{list:?}");
}
```



#### 13.1.2.2 Using `Box<T>` to Get a Recursive Type with a Known Size

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
enum List {
    Cons(i32, Box<List>),
    Nil,
}

use crate::List::{Cons, Nil};

fn main() {
    let list = Cons(1, Box::new(Cons(2, Box::new(Cons(3, Box::new(Nil))))));
    
    println!("{list:?}");
}
```



## 13.2 Treating Smart Pointers Like Regular References with the `Deref` Trait

Implementing the `Deref` trait allows you to customize the behavior of the *dereference* operator `*`.

### 13.2.1 Following the Pointer to the Value

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = &x;
    
    assert_eq!(5, x);   // ok
    assert_eq!(5, *y);  // ok
    //assert_eq!(5, y); // can't compare `{integer}` with `&{integer}`
}
```



### 13.2.2 Using `Box<T>` Like a Reference

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = Box::new(x); // use a `Box<T>` instead of a reference
    
    assert_eq!(5, x);
    assert_eq!(5, *y);
}
```



### 13.2.3 Defining Our Own Smart Pointer

```rust
struct MyBox<T>(T);

impl<T> MyBox<T> {
    fn new(x: T) -> MyBox<T> {
        MyBox(x)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = MyBox::new(x);
    
    assert_eq!(5, x);
    assert_eq!(5, *y);
}
```

Here's the resulting compilation error:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling deref-example v0.1.0 (E:\HHZ\gitee.com\elihe\learn-rust\18-smart-pointer\deref-example)

```



### 13.2.4 Treating a Type Like a Reference by Implementing the `Deref` Trait 

```rust
use std::ops::Deref;

impl<T> Deref for MyBox<T> {
    type Target = T;
    
    fn deref(&self) -> &Self::Target {
        &self.0
    }
}
```

Without the `Deref` trait, the compiler can only dereference `&` references. The `deref` method gives the compiler the ability to take a value of any type that implements `Deref` and call the `deref` method to get a `&` reference that it knows how to dereference.

The `*y`, behind the scenes Rust actually run this code:

```rust
*(y.deref())
```



### 13.2.5 Implicit `Deref` Coercions with Functions and Methods

*`Deref` coercion* converts a reference to a type that implements the `Deref` trait into a reference to another type.

`Deref` coercion was added to Rust so that programmers writing function and method calls don't need to add as many explicit references and dereferences with `&` and `*`.

```rust
fn main() {
    let m = MyBox::new(String::from("Rust"));
    hello(&m);
}

fn hello(name: &str) {
    println!("Hello, {name}!");
}
```

`Deref` coercion makes it possible to call `hello` with a reference to a value of type `MyBox<String>`.

The code we would have to write if Rust didn't have `deref` coercion

```rust
fn main() {
    let m = MyBox::new(String::from("Rust"));
    hello(&(*m)[..]);
}
```



### 13.2.6 How `Deref` Coercion Interacts with Mutability

Rust does `deref` coercion when it finds types and trait implementations in three cases:

- From `&T` to `&U` when `T: Deref<Target=u>`
- From `&mut T` to `mut U` when `T: DerefMut<Target=U>`
- From `&mut T` to `&U` when `T:Deref<Target=u>`



## 13.3 Running Code on Cleanup with the Drop Trait

The `Drop` trait lets you customize what happens when a value is about to go out of scope.

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct CustomSmartPointer {
    data: String
}

impl Drop for CustomSmartPointer {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        println!("Drop CustomSmartPointer with data `{}`", self.data);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let a = CustomSmartPointer { data: String::from("a stuff") };
    let b = CustomSmartPointer { data: String::from("b stuff") };
    
    println!("{a:?}\n{b:?}");
}
```



### 13.3.1 Dropping a Value Early with `std::mem::drop`

Unfortunately, it's not straightforward to disable the automatic `drop` functionality. Disabling `drop` isn't usually necessary; the whole point of the `Drop` trait is that it's taken care of automatically.

```rust
use std::mem::drop;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct CustomSmartPointer {
    data: String
}

impl Drop for CustomSmartPointer {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        println!("Drop CustomSmartPointer with data `{}`", self.data);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let c = CustomSmartPointer { data: String::from("some stuff") };
  
    println!("CustomSmartPointer created.");
    
    //c.drop(); // explicit destructor calls not allowed
    drop(c);
    
    println!("CustomSmartPointer dropped before the end of main.");
}
```



## 13.4 `Rc<T>`, the Reference Counted Smart Pointer

`Rc<T>` is an abbreviation for *reference counting*, it keeps track of the number of references to a value to determine whether or not the value is still in use. If there are zero references to a value, the value can be cleaned up without any references becoming invalid.

Note that `Rc<T>` is only for use in single-threaded scenarios.



### 13.4.1 Using `Rc<T>` to Share Data

Not allowed to have two lists using `Box<T>` that try to share ownership of a third list:

```rust
#![allow(unused_variables)]
enum List {
    Cons(i32, Box<List>),
    Nil,
}

use crate::List::{Cons, Nil};

fn main() {
    let a = Cons(5, Box::new(Cons(10, Box::new(Nil))));
    let b = Cons(3, Box::new(a));
    let c = Cons(4, Box::new(a));
}
```

To compile the code, and get this error:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling cons-list v0.1.0 (E:\HHZ\gitee.com\elihe\learn-rust\18-smart-pointer\cons-list)
error[E0382]: use of moved value: `a`

   |

   |         - move occurs because `a` has type `List`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
11 |     let b = Cons(3, Box::new(a));
   |                              - value moved here
12 |     let c = Cons(4, Box::new(a));
   |                              ^ value used here after move

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0382`.
error: could not compile `cons-list` (bin "cons-list") due to previous error
```



Use `Rc<T>` in place of `Box<T>`, and use `Rc::clone` to copy data, it doesn't a deep copy, only increments the reference count, which doesn't take much time.

```rust
#![allow(unused_variables)]

use std::rc::Rc;

enum List {
    Cons(i32, Rc<List>),
    Nil,
}

use crate::List::{Cons, Nil};

fn main() {
    let a = Rc::new(Cons(5, Rc::new(Cons(10, Rc::new(Nil)))));
    let b = Cons(3, Rc::clone(&a));
    let c = Cons(4, Rc::clone(&a));
}
```



 ### 13.4.2 Cloning an `Rc<T>` Increases the Reference Count

```rust
#![allow(unused_variables)]

use std::rc::Rc;

enum List {
    Cons(i32, Rc<List>),
    Nil,
}

use crate::List::{Cons, Nil};

fn main() {
    let a = Rc::new(Cons(5, Rc::new(Cons(10, Rc::new(Nil)))));
    println!("count after creating a = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));  // 1
    
    let b = Cons(3, Rc::clone(&a));
    println!("count after creating b = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));  // 2
    
    {
        let c = Cons(4, Rc::clone(&a));
        println!("count after creating c = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));  // 3
    }
    
    println!("count after c goes out of scope = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));  // 2
}
```



## 13.5 `RefCell<T>` and the Interior Mutability Pattern

*Interior mutability* is a design pattern in Rust that allows you to mutate data even when there are immutable references to that data; normally this action is disallowed by the borrowing rules.

To mutate data, the pattern uses `unsafe` code inside a data structure to bend Rust's usual rules that govern mutation and borrowing.



### 13.5.1 Enforcing Borrowing Rules at Runtime with `RefCell<T>`

Unlike `Rc<T>`, the `RefCell<T>` type represents single ownership over the data it holds. 

The borrowing rules:

- At any given time, you can have *either*(but not both) one mutable reference or any number of immutable references.
- References must always be valid.

With references and `Box<T>`, the borrowing rules' invariants are enforced at compile time. With `RefCell<T>`, these invariants are enforced *at runtime*.

With references, if you break these rules, you'll get a compiler error. With `RefCell<T>`, if you break these rules, you program will panic and exit.

Similar to `Rc<T>`, `RefCell<T>` is only for use in single-threaded scenarios and will give you a compile-time error if you try using it in a multi-threaded context.

Here is a recap of the reasons to choose `Box<T>`, `Rc<T>`, or `RefCell<T>` :

- `Rc<T>` enables multiple owners of the same data; `Box<T>` and `RefCell<T>` have single owner.
- `Box<T>` allows immutable or mutable borrows checked at compile time; `Rc<T>` allows only immutable borrows checked at compile time; `RefCell<T>` allows immutable or mutable borrows checked at runtime.
- Because `RefCell<T>` allows mutable borrows checked at runtime, you can  mutate the value inside the `RefCell<T>` even when the `RefCell<T>` is immutable.



### 13.5.2 Interior Mutability: A Mutable Borrow to an Immutable Value

A consequence of the borrowing rule is that when you have an immutable value, you can't borrow it mutably.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = &mut x;  // cannot borrow as mutable
}
```



#### 13.5.2.1 A Use Case for interior Mutability: Mock Object

```test
pub trait Messager {
    fn send(&self, msg: &str);
}

pub struct LimitTracker<'a, T: Messager> {
    messager: &'a T,
    value: usize,
    max: usize,
}

impl<'a, T> LimitTracker<'a, T>
where
    T: Messager,
{
    pub fn new(messager: &'a T, max: usize) -> LimitTracker<'a, T> {
        LimitTracker {
            messager,
            value: 0,
            max,
        }
    }
    
    pub fn set_value(&mut self, value: usize) {
        self.value = value;
        
        let percentage_of_max = self.value as f64 / self.max as f64;
        
        if percentage_of_max >= 1.0 {
            self.messager.send("Error: You are over quota!");
        } else if percentage_of_max >= 0.9 {
            self.messager.send("Urgent warning: You've used up over 90% of your quota!");
        } else if percentage_of_max >= 0.75 {
            self.messager.send("Warning: You've used up over 75% of your quota!");
        }
    }
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    
    struct MockMessager {
        sent_messages: Vec<String>,
    }
    
    impl MockMessager {
        fn new() -> MockMessager {
            MockMessager {
                sent_messages: vec![],
            }
        }
    }
    
    impl Messager for MockMessager {
        fn send(&self, message: &str) {
            self.sent_messages.push(String::from(message));
        }
    }
    
    #[test]
    fn it_sends_over_75_percent_warning_message() {
        let mock_messager = MockMessager::new();
        let mut limit_tracker = LimitTracker::new(&mock_messager, 100);
        
        limit_tracker.set_value(80);
        
        assert_eq!(mock_messager.sent_messages.len(), 1);
    }
}
```

There's one problem with this test, as shown here:

```rust
$ cargo test

error: could not compile `borrowing` (lib test) due to previous error
warning: build failed, waiting for other jobs to finish...
```

We can't modify the `MockMessager` to keep track of the messages, because the `send` method takes an immutable reference to `self`. We also can't take the suggestion from the error text to use `&mu self` instead, because then the signature of `send` wouldn't match the signature in the `Messenger` trait definition (feel free to try and see what error message you get)

This is situation in which interior mutability can help! We'll store the `sent_messages` within a `RefCell<T>`, and then the `send` method will be able to modify `sent_messages` to store the messages we've seen.

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    use std::cell::RefCell;
    
    struct MockMessager {
        sent_messages: RefCell<Vec<String>>,
    }
    
    impl MockMessager {
        fn new() -> MockMessager {
            MockMessager {
                sent_messages: RefCell::new(vec![]),
            }
        }
    }
    
    impl Messager for MockMessager {
        fn send(&self, message: &str) {
            self.sent_messages.borrow_mut().push(String::from(message));
        }
    }
    
    #[test]
    fn it_sends_over_75_percent_warning_message() {
        let mock_messager = MockMessager::new();
        let mut limit_tracker = LimitTracker::new(&mock_messager, 100);
        
        limit_tracker.set_value(80);
        
        assert_eq!(mock_messager.sent_messages.borrow().len(), 1);
    }
}
```

The `sent_messages` fields is now of type `RefCell<Vec<String>>` instead of `Vec<String>`. In the `new` function, we create a new `RefCell<Vec<String>>` instance around the empty vector.

To call `borrow_mut` on the `RefCell<Vec<String>>` in `self.sent_messages` to get a mutable reference to the value inside the `RefCell<Vec<String>>`, which is the vector.

To call `borrow` on the `RefCell<Vec<String>>` to get an immutable reference to the vector.



#### 15.5.2.2 Keeping Track of Borrows at Running with `RefCell<T>`

When creating immutable and mutable references, we use the `&` and `&mut` syntax, respectively. With `RefCell<T>`, we use the `borrow` and `borrow_mut` methods. The `borrow` method returns the smart pointer type `Ref<T>`, and `borrow_mut` returns the smart pointer type `RefMut<T>`. Both types implement `Deref`, so we can treat them like regular references.

Every time we call `borrow`, the `RefCell<T>` increases its count of how many immutable borrows are active. When a `Ref<T>` values goes out of scope, the count of immutable borrows goes down by one.

```rust
    impl Messager for MockMessager {
        fn send(&self, message: &str) {
            // self.sent_messages.borrow_mut().push(String::from(message));
            let mut one_borrow = self.sent_messages.borrow_mut();
            let mut two_borrow = self.sent_messages.borrow_mut();
            
            one_borrow.push(String::from(message));
            two_borrow.push(String::from(message));
        }
    }
```

This makes two mutable references in the same scope, which isn't allowed:

        }
    }

    println!("a rc count after b creation = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));
    println!("b initial rc count = {}", Rc::strong_count(&b));
    println!("b next item = {:?}", b.tail());
    
    // make a reference cycle of two `List` values pointing to each others
    if let Some(link) = a.tail() {
        *link.borrow_mut() = Rc::clone(&b);
    }
    
    println!("b rc count after changing a = {}", Rc::strong_count(&b)); // 2
    println!("a rc count after changing a = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a)); // 2
    
    // Uncomment the next line to see that we have a cycle;
    // it will overflow the stack
    //println!("a next item = {:?}", a.tail());
}
```



### 13.6.2 Preventing Reference Cycles: Turing an `Rc<T>` into a `Weak<T>`

You can create a *weak reference* to the value within an `Rc<T>` instance by calling `Rc::downgrade` and passing a reference to the `Rc<T>`.

Strong references are how you can share ownership of an `Rc<T>` instance. Weak references don't express an ownership relationship, and their count doesn't affect when an `Rc<T>` instance is cleaned up.

When you call `Rc::downgrade`, you get a smart pointer of type `Weak<T>`. Instead of increasing the `strong_count` in the `Rc<T>` instance by 1, calling `Rc::downgrade` increases the `weak_count` by 1.

    children: RefCell<Vec<Rc<Node>>>,

fn main() {

### 13.6.2.2 Adding a Reference from a Child to Its Parent

```rust
use std::cell::RefCell;
use std::rc::{Rc, Weak};

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    parent: RefCell<Weak<Node>>,
    children: RefCell<Vec<Rc<Node>>>,
}

fn main() {
    let leaf = Rc::new(Node {
        value: 3,
        parent: RefCell::new(Weak::new()),
        children: RefCell::new(vec![]),
    });
    
    println!("leaf parent = {:?}", leaf.parent.borrow().upgrade());
    
    let branch = Rc::new(Node {
        value: 5,
        parent: RefCell::new(Weak::new()),
        children: RefCell::new(vec![Rc::clone(&leaf)]),
    });
    
    *leaf.parent.borrow_mut() = Rc::downgrade(&branch);
    
    println!("leaf parent = {:?}", leaf.parent.borrow().upgrade());
    
    println!("{branch:?}");
}
```

some explains:

- `Rc::downgrade()`: to create a `Weak<Node>` reference to `branch` from the `Rc<Node>` in `branch`
- `upgrade()`: a method in `Weak<T>` instance , which will return an `Option<Rc<T>>`



#### 13.6.2.3 Visualizing Changes to `strong_count` and `weak_count`

```rust
use std::cell::RefCell;
use std::rc::{Rc, Weak};

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    parent: RefCell<Weak<Node>>,
    children: RefCell<Vec<Rc<Node>>>,
}

fn main() {
    let leaf = Rc::new(Node {
        value: 3,
        parent: RefCell::new(Weak::new()),
        children: RefCell::new(vec![]),
    });
    
    // 1, 0
    println!(
        "leaf strong = {}, weak = {}",
        Rc::strong_count(&leaf),
        Rc::weak_count(&leaf),
    );
    
    {
        let branch = Rc::new(Node {
            value: 5,
            parent: RefCell::new(Weak::new()),
            children: RefCell::new(vec![Rc::clone(&leaf)]),
        });
    
        *leaf.parent.borrow_mut() = Rc::downgrade(&branch);
        
        // 1, 1
        println!(
            "branch strong = {}, weak = {}",
            Rc::strong_count(&branch),
            Rc::weak_count(&branch),
        );
        
        // 2, 0
        println!(
            "leaf strong = {}, weak = {}",
            Rc::strong_count(&leaf),
            Rc::weak_count(&leaf),
        );
    }
    
    // None
    println!("leaf parent = {:?}", leaf.parent.borrow().upgrade());
   
    // 1, 0
    println!(
        "leaf strong = {}, weak = {}",
        Rc::strong_count(&leaf),
        Rc::weak_count(&leaf),
    );
}
